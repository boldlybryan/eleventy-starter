title: About me
permalink: /about/

This about page lives under ```/pages/about``` in the Eleventy root directory. It's an example of how you can create an organized folder structure that won't messy up the root.

Each folder needs to have a json file of it's own that defines the permalink URL structure. Additionally, you can define other data in there, such as a custom layout, or any other data a site section may need.
